# Base_EE-DE_Builder

## Project Overview

Base_EE-DE_Builder provides a toolkit and reference implementation for creating custom Ansible Execution Environments (EE) and Development Environments (DE) specifically designed for use with Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). This project streamlines the workflow of building, publishing, and utilizing containerized environments in your AAP infrastructure.

## Purpose & Workflow

This project serves as a guide and reference implementation for:

1. **Building** custom EE/DE containers with specific dependencies and tools
2. **Publishing** these environments to your Automation Hub
3. **Deploying** them to your AAP Controller
4. **Utilizing** them in your automation workflows

## Key Components

- **Environment Definitions**: Reference implementations demonstrating how to define EE/DE containers
- **Build Scripts**: Utilities to streamline container creation
- **Documentation**: Guidance on integrating with AAP infrastructure
- **Examples**: Working configurations for common use cases

## Environment Definition Templates

The project provides two approaches to defining environments:

### 1. Single-File Definition (`base_environment_definition_1-file`)
- All configuration in a single YAML file
- Simpler for straightforward environments
- Easier management for basic needs

### 2. Multi-File Definition (`base_environment_definition_4-file`)
- Configuration split across multiple specialized files:
  - `execution-environment.yml`: Main configuration
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
  - `bindep.txt`: System dependencies  
  - `requirements.yml`: Ansible Collections
- Better for complex environments
- More maintainable for larger teams

## Specialized Environment References

Additional reference implementations include:
- RHEL 8-based environments
- Minimal configurations
- Development tool-enhanced environments

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaddGallegos/Base_EE-DE_Builder.git
   cd Base_EE-DE_Builder

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaddGallegos/Base_EE-DE_Builder.git
   cd Base_EE-DE_Builder
   ```

2. Review the environment definitions in the `environments/` directory

3. Choose a definition approach (single or multi-file)

4. Customize for your needs

5. Build your environment:
   ```bash
   ansible-builder build -t your-environment-name -f path/to/execution-environment.yml
   ```

6. Push to your Automation Hub:
   ```bash
   podman push your-environment-name your-automation-hub.example.com/your-environment-name
   ```

7. Configure the environment in AAP Controller for use in your automation projects

## Use with Ansible Automation Platform

This project is specifically designed to work with the Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem:

- **Automation Hub Integration**: Push custom environments to your private Automation Hub
- **Controller Compatibility**: Environments are built to be fully compatible with AAP Controller
- **Execution Node Ready**: Optimized for deployment on AAP execution nodes
- **Automation Mesh Support**: Works with distributed execution via Automation Mesh
